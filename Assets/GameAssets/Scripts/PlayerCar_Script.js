// ----------- CAR TUTORIAL SAMPLE PROJECT, ? Andrew Gotow 2009 -----------------

// Here's the basic car script described in my tutorial at www.gotow.net/andrew/blog.
// A Complete explaination of how this script works can be found at the link above, along
// with detailed instructions on how to write one of your own, and tips on what values to 
// assign to the script variables for it to work well for your application.

// Contact me at Maxwelldoggums@Gmail.com for more information.




// These variables allow the script to power the wheels of the car.
var FrontLeftWheel : WheelCollider;
var FrontRightWheel : WheelCollider;

// These variables are for the gears, the array is the list of ratios. The script
// uses the defined gear ratios to determine how much torque to apply to the wheels.
var GearRatio:float[];

var CurrentGear : int = 0;

// These variables are just for applying torque to the wheels and shifting gears.
// using the defined Max and Min Engine RPM, the script can determine what gear the
// car needs to be in.
var EngineTorque : float = 1000.0;
var MaxEngineRPM : float = 5000.0;
var MinEngineRPM : float = 1000.0;
private var EngineRPM : float = 0.0;



function Start () {
	// I usually alter the center of mass to make the car more stable. I'ts less likely to flip this way.
	rigidbody.centerOfMass.y = 0.0;
	
	//GearRatio = new float[5];
	//for (var i=0; i<5; i++)
	//{
	//	GearRatio[i] = i;
	//}
}

function Update () {
	
	// This is to limith the maximum speed of the car, adjusting the drag probably isn't the best way of doing it,
	// but it's easy, and it doesn't interfere with the physics processing.
	rigidbody.drag = rigidbody.velocity.magnitude / 250;
	
	// Compute the engine RPM based on the average RPM of the two wheels, then call the shift gear function
	EngineRPM = (FrontLeftWheel.rpm + FrontRightWheel.rpm)/2 * GearRatio[CurrentGear];
	ShiftGears();

	// set the audio pitch to the percentage of RPM to the maximum RPM plus one, this makes the sound play
	// up to twice it's pitch, where it will suddenly drop when it switches gears.
/*	audio.pitch = Mathf.Abs(EngineRPM / MaxEngineRPM) + 1.0 ;
	// this line is just to ensure that the pitch does not reach a value higher than is desired.
	if ( audio.pitch > 2.0 ) {
		audio.pitch = 2.0;
	}*/

	// finally, apply the values to the wheels.	The torque applied is divided by the current gear, and
	// multiplied by the user input variable.
	FrontLeftWheel.motorTorque = EngineTorque / GearRatio[CurrentGear] * Input.GetAxis("Vertical");
	FrontRightWheel.motorTorque = EngineTorque / GearRatio[CurrentGear] * Input.GetAxis("Vertical");
		
	// the steer angle is an arbitrary value multiplied by the user input.
	FrontLeftWheel.steerAngle = 10 * Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
	FrontRightWheel.steerAngle = 10 * Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
}

function ShiftGears() {
	// this funciton shifts the gears of the vehcile, it loops through all the gears, checking which will make
	// the engine RPM fall within the desired range. The gear is then set to this "appropriate" value.
